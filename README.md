# LearnWithMe 
This is a repo in which I wanna share my notes and collab notebooks for the world. I personally learned these things myself.
All the resources about that perticular topic are in notebook it self. 

I hope it can help you a bit.

If you can learn these things as you like, but I have a proper structure:

0. Have an overview on RoadMap for Ml-DL
1. Numpy and Pandas
2. Intro to machine learning   Make a small project`

I will keep on updating this repo as I go on more. As I learn more I will keep adding more notebooks and resources.
